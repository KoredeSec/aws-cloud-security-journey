# 🛡️ 100 Days of AWS Cloud Security  
**Real-World Security Projects | Documented Weekly by [@KoredeSec](https://github.com/KoredeSec)**

Welcome to my 100 Days of AWS Cloud Security journey, where I dive into practical AWS security projects and document everything.  
This isn’t theory, it’s a build-in-public challenge to level up, break things, secure them, and grow as a DevSecOps engineer.

## 📌 What This Is

Every week, I take on one hands-on AWS cloud security task that simulates real-world risks and solutions.

Each task includes:
- 📁 A dedicated folder with code, configs, and write-ups
- 📷 Screenshots & architecture diagrams (where applicable)
- ✍️ A full breakdown post on [my Medium](https://medium.com/@Korede_Sec)

**What I did:**
- Created a secure IAM user with MFA  
- Set up CloudTrail across regions
